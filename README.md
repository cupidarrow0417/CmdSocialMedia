# CmdSocialMedia
This is the final project of _Advanced Programming Lecture_ 
at _Yazd University_ in Spring Semester, 2020.
I was one of the TA's of this lecture, so I wanted to do the project myself.

## Project Subject
Simulation of social media apps like Instagram or Twitter in cmd environment.
Project should be written in **Java** language and students must leverage _RandomAccessFile_ in order to
save changes through the program in files.

## Tools
It wasn't part of the project, but I used **Lombok** and **Reflection** in some parts.
